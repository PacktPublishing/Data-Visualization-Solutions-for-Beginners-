## About the Video Course
Take this course and get your fundamentals in place, so you can make visualizations on your own with the correct use of various visualization elements. The course moves slowly from fundamental topics to advanced topics with tons of examples. We also focus on making you independent of these tools, so you can carry forward your visualization knowledge to any other tool you need to use.
